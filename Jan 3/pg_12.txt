''' what is the difference between list and tuples in python '''

list
    used to store multiple items in single variable 
    it is mutable, ie, we can change the values
    size is greater than tuple 
    slower as we compare with tuple

    add element in end 
        list_name.append(item)
    
    add element at any place 
        list_name.insert[index, item]
    
    add multiple elements
        list_name.extend([item1, item2, item3,..])
    
    remove element
        list_name.pop(value)
    
    remove multiple element
        del list_name[index]

tuples
    parathesis is used to represent the tuples 
    eg: tuple()
    collection of ordered and immutable elements
    once the tuple is decleared, then the elements are not changable 
    less size as we compare with list
    faster than list
